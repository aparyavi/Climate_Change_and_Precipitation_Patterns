# Climate_Change_and_Precipitation_Patterns

Global Warming is becoming an increasingly important issue due to the effects it's having on humans and the environment all over the world. That is why it has been the center of attention in large humanitarian and goverment institutions.

We have decided to base our final project on issues of global warming and its effects on the environment. The one particular side effect we are going to be looking at is change in percepitation patterns around the world. We have gathered data from Our World in Data and NOAA to analyse the patterns of global warming and percepitation throughout the decades.

We believe that we are going to be see subtle changes in some parts of the world but some more drastic changes in percepitation in some other regions. This is because the global warming has caused more dramatic temperatures by giving us colder winters and hotter summers. However, places were temparature is fairly constant throughout the year, we believe might not be effected by global warming as much. These regions tend to lie closer to the equator. Now let's see if our hypothesis is correct.
